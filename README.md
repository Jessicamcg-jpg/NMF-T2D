# NMF-T2D
Uncovering Type 2 Diabetes Subtypes from Gene Expression Data Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization
Summer research project 2025, part of Summer Scholarship funding from School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences. 

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease distinguished by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose level. Conventional approaches typically treat T2D as a homogeneous condition, yet this obscures clinically relevant heterogeneity among patients and may limit the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Identifying distinct subtypes offers a means to capture this variation, giving insights into disease mechanisms, prognosis, and opportunities for more targeted treatment. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been demonstrated to be effective for identifying patients at greater risk of complications and allowing intervention strategies. In this study, NMF was used to spot patterns in gene expression data associated with Type 2 Diabetes. The datasets GSE18732 and GSE41762 were downloaded and accessed via the GEOquery R package to inspect sample names, true labels, and expression data. After preprocessing, the filtered expression data were analyzed using NMF. Using this method, samples were stratified into diabetic and non-diabetic groups based on phenotypic or clinical groups. The results showed that NMF is able to identify biologically distinct subgroups in both pancreatic and skeletal muscle datasets. In addition, a KL divergence model is better suited for NMF-based clustering with count like distributions.
